			<h3> Disadvantages </h3>
			<p>I don't play games and can definitely justify why is that so.
Playing games takes up a lot of time in general and whoever says they play games in a limited amount of time are lying to their teeth.
I have observed that all my gamer friends keep involved in the game even after they stop playing. In their back of mind they still think about how to complete a particular level or how to tackle a problem in the game.
 Playing video games causes your brain to release dopamine. Dopamine is important for learning and concentration, but it is also the same chemical released when people do drugs like cocaine. If you spend too much time playing video you could develop a gaming disorder and that's facts.
