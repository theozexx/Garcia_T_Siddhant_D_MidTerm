			<p class="align">
				1. Improves coordination
				When an adult or child is playing a video game, he or she is not only staring at the computer inactively. The activities and actions on the screen provide a lot of mental stimulation. For one to play, he or she will need to coordinate their visual, audial and physical movement.
				<br>
				2. Improves problem-solving skills
				Video games involve certain rules. This means that the player has to think carefully before making any move to ensure that they stay within the required rules of that particular game. The player needs to make split- second decisions that will determine whether or not he or she will advance to the next level.

			<h3 class="align"> Disadvantages </h3>
			<p class="align"> I don't play games and can definitely justify why is that so.
				Playing games takes up a lot of time in general and whoever says they play games in a limited amount of time are lying to their teeth.
				I have observed that all my gamer friends keep involved in the game even after they stop playing. In their back of mind they still think about how to complete a particular level or how to tackle a problem in the game.
				Playing video games causes your brain to release dopamine. Dopamine is important for learning and concentration, but it is also the same chemical released when people do drugs like cocaine. If you spend too much time playing video you could develop a gaming disorder and that's facts.
